I'm really sorry to everyone trying to evaluate my submissions for part 4 and part 5 since i forgot to create another folder for part 5 and committed changes to the part 4 folder instead.

I wanted to correct my mistake but I'm afraid that I'll do something terrible and broke the entire repo, so uhh... yeah, please accept my apology.

P.S I committed every exercise so if you wanted to see the state of the bloglist project from part 4, just browse through the commit log :)
